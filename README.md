# hello-world
Starting CS50
I'm currently stuck in a rut! I desperately want to change career. One thing I enjoy at work is coding but I only get to dabble occasionally, I'd like to explore doing it properly and moving into a new career in IT/programming. I'm starting by taking the CS50 online course from HarvardX. My first assignment was to creat a github account so I can submit work. I'm currently just working through the github guide.
